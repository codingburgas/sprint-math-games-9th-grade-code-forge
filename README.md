## Game Descriptions
### 1. Hangman
* Input a single letter at a time to guess the word.
* You have a limited number of attempts, which depends on the chosen difficulty level.
* Choose between Easy, Medium, or Hard difficulty to customize your challenge.

### 2. Wordle
* Guess the correct word within a limited number of attempts.
* The `*` signifies a correct letter, but it is not in the correct place.
* The `_` signifies that the letter is not included in the word.
* Correctly guessed letters in the correct position remain visible in the word.

### 3. Word Scramble
* You will be given a scrambled word to guess.
* You have a limited number of incorrect guesses based on difficulty.
* The game ends when you guess the word or run out of attempts.
