## About
We are CodeForge, this is our project where we made games to help you learn more about math and practice your English skills using various games like "Hangman", "Wordle", and so on!

## Game Descriptions
### 1. Hangman
* Input a single letter at a time to guess the word.
* You have a limited number of attempts, which depends on the chosen difficulty level.
* Choose between Easy, Medium, or Hard difficulty to customize your challenge.

### 2. Wordle
* Guess the correct word within a limited number of attempts.
* The `*` signifies a correct letter, but it is not in the correct place.
* The `_` signifies that the letter is not included in the word.
* Correctly guessed letters in the correct position remain visible in the word.
